I am a MS-Ph.D student in AI at [Korea University](https://info.korea.edu/en_info/grad/ai_intro.do), advised by [Prof. Sungjoon Choi](https://sites.google.com/view/sungjoon-choi).

My research goal is to enable robots to tackle complex and challenging tasks what humans do daily in a scalable way. To this end, I'm interested in the area of generalizable AI, with a fcous on reinforcement learning and generative models.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Intelligent Robot Engineering at [Dongguk University](https://www.dongguk.edu/). My previous internship includes working on safe skill learning for legged robots and large vision-language models for robots in [NAVER LABS](https://www.naverlabs.com/)
